1.  stdint.h is a header file that contains definitions of new integer types. This will allow my program to have for example a fixed-width integer type int32_t and thus, 32 bits anywhere, since I cannot assure that the actual size of integer in my program is always 32 bits or long long is always 64 bits.
2.  They are exact-width integer types. uint8_t is a typedef unsigned char, which means it is an unsigned char of 8 bits. uint32_t is a typedef unsigned long int, which means it is an unsigned long integer of 32 bits. int32_t is a typedef signed long int, which means it is a signed long integer of 32 bits. uint16_t is a typedef unsigned int, which means it is an unsigned integer of 16 bits.
3.  A BYTE is 1 byte, a DWORD is 4 bytes, a LONG is 4 bytes, a WORD is 2 bytes.
4.  Character "B" then character "M" (in ASCII).
5.  bfSize is the size of the bitmap file, measured in bytes. biSize is the size of the image, measured in bytes.
6.  The bitmap will be a top-down device-independent bitmap (DIB) with the origin at the upper left corner.
7.  biBitCount specifies it.
8.  In line 24, the input file might be empty. In line 32, since input file is empty, output file will be empty too.
9.  It is like a pointer, reading 1 item at a time.
10. 3
11. It moves the position of a file to another location within the file itself.
12. It is the current position indicator in the file.
